# Coordinator runbook

For whichever agent is coordinating: a Claude Code session in a main checkout, or a person
by hand. There can be any number of coordinators at once; the board is what keeps them out
of each other's way. A coordinator writes no feature code. It cuts work into path-disjoint
tasks, writes briefs, dispatches workers, verifies every claim with the gate, gets a
cross-model review where money or personal data is involved, merges, and keeps the record
true. **All state is on disk or on the board**; a new coordinator needs only this file, the
plan, the briefs, and `skein status`.

To start a coordinator: open a session in your own checkout and paste
`docs/plan/COORDINATOR-PROMPT.md`.

## The commands
Every step below is a `skein` command, vendored at `scripts/skein/skein` so it is the same on
every machine and in CI:

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| see the DAG, what is ready, what overlaps | `skein plan` |
| validate or scaffold a brief | `skein brief <ID> --check` / `--new` |
| claim, create the workspace, launch the worker | `skein dispatch <ID>` |
| wait for the envelope | `skein watch <ID>` |
| everything running, board and local, both caps | `skein status` |
| talk to a worker | `skein send <ID> "message"` |
| the merge gate | `skein gate <ID>` |
| cross-model review of the PR | `skein review <ID>` |
| gate, squash-merge, close the claim, delete the workspace | `skein merge <ID>` |

## Cutting work into tasks
A flock only runs several agents at once when several tasks exist whose `owned` globs do not
overlap and whose `deps` are merged. That is the whole trick. When you add a task to
`docs/plan/wps.json`:
- Give it disjoint `owned` globs. `skein plan` prints overlaps among ready tasks.
- Give it `accept` commands the gate can run without anyone's secrets.
- Mark `money: true` or `pii: true` when it touches payments, ledgers, credentials, or personal
  data. Both make a cross-model review mandatory, and `skein merge` refuses without one.
- Anything under `coordinatorOwned` is a coordinator change first (a branch, a short ADR under
  `docs/adr/`, a PR), then a task.

## Claims: N coordinators, one board
The board (github) holds one entry per task, titled `<ID>: <title>`. **Assigning yourself
is the claim**; an unassigned entry is free, an assigned one is someone else's. `skein
dispatch` claims before it creates a workspace and refuses a task someone else holds. `skein
merge` refuses a task you do not hold. State labels (`ready`, `running`, `gating`, `blocked`)
move with the task and read the same in the board UI and in `skein status`.

Two caps bound a dispatch: your machine's (`~/.skein/config.json` `maxAgents`, default 3) and
the repo's (`.skein/config.json` `maxAgents`), counted across all coordinators through the
board. The smaller wins.

Single-writer, always: the files under `coordinatorOwned`. One coordinator changes them at a
time, through a PR the others can see.

## Dispatch
A task is dispatchable when it has a valid brief, its deps are merged, and both the brief and
the plan are on `origin/main` (workspaces fork from origin, not from your local branch).
```bash
CLI_COORDINATOR=1 git push origin main   # briefs and the plan must be on origin
skein dispatch <ID>                         # model from .skein/config.json worker policy
skein watch <ID>
```
For a **resumed or follow-up** round, start the watcher **before** you send the prompt:
envelopes already on screen when it starts are ignored.

## When a worker reports DONE: the merge gate
**A worker's claim is not evidence.** In its worktree:
1. `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD`: only the task's owned paths.
2. `skein gate <ID>`, run by you, must end `SKEIN_GATE_RESULT … status=PASS`.
3. **Read the diff for anything the gate cannot see**: a handler that logs a payload, a query
   that reads-then-writes, a criterion vacuously satisfied. That is what the review is for.
4. **New dependency?** Verify it on the registry and its repository yourself.
5. **`skein review <ID>`** for any `money` or `pii` task: a different model family reviews in a
   read-only worktree and posts one PR comment. Triage each finding on its merits, post rulings
   on the PR, resume the author for fixes (`skein send`), then gate again.
6. **`skein merge <ID>`**: gate again, squash-merge, close the claim, delete the workspace,
   mark the task done in the plan.
7. After a wave, in your checkout: pull, reinstall, restart anything you run locally.

**Never merge without a human reading the diff** when a task touches production credentials,
live money, or infrastructure the team shares. Those are owner checkpoints whoever coordinates.

## Naming
| What | Shape | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Branch | `<type>/<slug>-<task-id>` | `fix/api-json-404-cli-01` |
| Workspace | `<type>: <slug in words> (<TASK-ID>)` | `fix: api json 404 (CLI-01)` |
| PR title | `<type>(<scope>): <summary> (<TASK-ID>)` | `fix(api): JSON 404 for unknown paths (CLI-01)` |
| Brief, gate, envelope, board | the task id, unchanged | `CLI-01` |

`skein dispatch` derives the branch and workspace name from the task's `type` and `slug`; the
gate's `--from-branch` resolves the task from the branch; `skein plan` reads the PR title on
`main` to know a task merged.

## Pushing to main
`scripts/githooks/pre-push` refuses a push to `main` unless `CLI_COORDINATOR=1` is set.
Branch protection with the gate as a required check is the real guard where the plan allows
it; the hook stops the accident, not the decision.

## Contract changes
Only a coordinator changes `coordinatorOwned` paths: a branch, a short ADR under `docs/adr/`,
the change, a PR the other coordinators can see, merge, then tell running workers to rebase.

## Talking to workers
`skein send <ID> "one line"`. After a usage-limit stall, send `continue`. To pause a worker:
tell it to make a WIP commit and end its turn.

## Hygiene, learned the expensive way
- **Workspaces fork from origin.** An unpushed brief, gate or lifecycle change is absent in the
  worktree. `skein dispatch` refuses if the brief or plan differs from origin.
- **Nobody polls GitHub.** The local gate is the evidence; look at CI once per PR.
- **Never `pkill -f <agent>`**: it kills other coordinators' workers and your own dev server.
  The lifecycle scripts scope by working directory or process group.
- Two tasks must never own the same file at once. Three tasks in one directory cost three
  merge rounds.
- Chain shell steps with `&&` when a later step must not run after a failure.
